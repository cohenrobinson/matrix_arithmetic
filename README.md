# matrix_arithmetic
General arithmetic functions associated with matrices.

Run the matrix_demo_exec to see demonstrations of the functions in action, otherwise write your own code by including the matrix.h library.

Functions included are:

- Square matrix products
- Vector-matrix products
- Matrix addition & subtration
- Matrix transpose
- Matrix trace
- Matrix rotation
- Gauss Jordan Elimination Method
- Row Operations

Next: Impliment Matrix Determinents and ability to enter matrices into terminal.
